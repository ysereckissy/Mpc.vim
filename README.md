# Mpc.vim

### What is Mpc.vim?
This is a vim plugin I am writing for the purpose of learning how to write vim plugins. I am following the examples
provided in the book The VimL Primer. My expectation is that by the end of reading this book, I come up with something
working exactly as what the author put together. 

### Installing Mpc.vim
add the following line to your .vimrc if you are using Vundle.
Plugin 'ysereckissy/Mpc.vim'

then run :PluginInstall to get it ready. 

Please note that you need to have mpd and mpc installed and properly configured to play with this baby version of the
plugin.
